I'm a biogeochemist, which means that I'm interested in the coupling between the biotic and abiotic world and I like to study the interactions between biology, geology, and chemistry... So basically, I'm interested in the composition of the entire natural environment. My background is very broad, having completed a [Liberal Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education#:~:text=Liberal%20arts%20generally%20covers%20three,science%2C%20sociology%2C%20and%20psychology.) programme (if you don't know it, you should look it up, it's pretty cool). I did manage to narrow it down to the environmental sciences and after doing some really exciting research on atmospheric chemistry, I delved into my research passion: marine biogeochemistry, specifically in the polar oceans! I absolutely __love__ the ice and the mysteries hidden in the depths of the sea. This passion has led me to Antarctica and the North Pole, so I'd say it's not too shabby. 

I focus on the the role of oceans and sea ice in the carbon cycle, which means I look a lot at inorganic carbon content in the sea water and CO2 fluxes with the atmosphere. So far, I've been doing this using an observational approach, which means that I collect samples and observations from the field and analyse those to study relevant processes. 

Currently, I'm doing a PhD at the University of East Anglia, funded by the [Natural Environment Research Council](https://nerc.ukri.org/). 

**Some things that I'll be putting on this page soon** 

- Links to my research and scripts. I think research should be as transparent and accessible as possible. I try to apply that to my own research by providing links to my work flow and methods. I'm still working on them, though, so this is in the pipeline! 
- Photos!! 
- Some more info on groups I'm working on, such as the VINDTA Users group on Slack 

**Some links about my involvement in Arctic Ocean research**
